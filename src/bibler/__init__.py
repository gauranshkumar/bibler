Updated on 06 Sep 2022



This is the main BiBler module.
Execute this module from the command line to start the application with a graphical user interface.
You can also interact with BiBler programmatically through its API as follows:

    >>> from BiBler import BiBler 
    >>> BiBler.start()    # starts the BiBler
    >>> BiBler.add('')    # adds an empty entry
    1 
    >>> BiBler.exit()    # closes BiBler
    
.. note:: You may also want to import Preferences (if you need to change the default settings) or Fields (to access a specific field of an entry)

.. attention:: This module assumes that the :ref:`gui` has a L{statechart.BiBler_Statechart} class and the :ref:`app` has a :ref:`Class BiBlerApp` that implements L{gui.app_interface.IApplication}.
