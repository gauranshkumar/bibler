# Source code

The source code is licensed under a [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 3](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) ![GNU GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)


## Dependencies
To compile the source code, you need the following dependencies:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9
- [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/) 4.0 or later to run in GUI mode
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) 3.0.1 or later to generate the documentation
- [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) 3.6 or later to create the executable distribution
- [spaCY](https://spacy.io/) 3.4 or later to perform natural language processing operations

## Usage

#### Running BiBler

To run the application with the GUI, simply run the `bibler` module from the command line like so.
It requires wxPython.
```console
python src/bibler/__init__.py
```

To run in head-less mode, simply import the `bibler` module and use the `bibler` object.
The main file is [`__init__.py`](__init__.py).
The available functions are listed in the [documentation](../../docs/index.html) of the `IApplication` interface in the `App_Interface` module.
```python
from bibler import bibler
bibler.start()      # starts the BiBler
bibler.addEntry('') # adds an empty entry
bibler.exit()       # closes BiBler
```

You can set the options of BiBler via the `Preferences` object.
```python
from bibler import *
Preferences.overrideKeyGeneration = True	# Generates a key for entries even if one is already provided
Preferences.bibStyle = BibStyle.DEFAULT		# Sets the bibliography style
```

#### Testing BiBler

All unit tests are available in the [`testApp`](testApp) module.
It requires PyUnit.
To run the tests, simply run:
```console
python testApp.py
```

To test open and import, you can use the sample BibTeX files in the [examples](../../examples) folder.

#### Building a distribution

BiBler is built and distributed as a executable package.
All the releases are available in the [build](../../build) folder.
To create a new release, open the [build.py](build.py) module and set `VERSION` to the version number.
Then, simply run:
```console
python build.py
```
It requires PyInstaller.
This will override the latest build in the [build/bibler](../../build/bibler) folder.
Finally, create a zip file of the build and deploy it as a new release.

#### Generating the source code documentation

It requires Sphinx.
